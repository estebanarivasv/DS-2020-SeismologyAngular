# Systems Design - Dise√±o de Sistemas (2020 - 2nd Semester)

## Summary

In this repository I have located a copy of the work I've done in Programming this year.
As the semester goes by, we will be making some code optimizations to the current one.

The main goal of this subject is to learn how to develop any system with good practices.

We will be learning how to learn typescript in order to work with Angular.

## ***Libraries I've used:***

Here there is the main libraries that I've used in my project:

- [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) (Framework web)
- [flask_restful](https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (REST Api)
- [flask_sqlalchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/) (Integration with SQLAlchemy)
- [flask_jwt_extended](https://flask-jwt-extended.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (Users authentication)
- [flask_mail](https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Mail/) (Email delivery of sensors status)
- [marshmallow-sqlalchemy](https://marshmallow-sqlalchemy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (Serialization and deserialization of SQLAlchemy db.Models)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) (Seisms API and db workarounds)
- [Flask-APScheduler](https://github.com/viniciuschiele/flask-apscheduler) (Jobs for the flask api)

## ***Diagrams:***

#### *User-case diagram*
Here in this scheme, I described the general behaviour of the system. 
Basically we've desplayed the system and three different user types: the administrators, the seismologists and the analists or all the rest of the organization.

Every one of them has specific tasks:
The administrators is able to:
- Assign sensors to seismologists.
- Have access to existent sensors: modify, activate or deactivate.
- Register new users.

The seismologists can:
- List left seisms to validate.
- List assigned sensors.
- Modify unverified seisms data. 
  - If it is an excessive amount of data to verify, they can download it. 
  - If there are not mistakes left, the users can validate the seism.

The analists (or any other institute member) is be able to:
- Access verified seisms.
- Filter and download the sensors data in a CSV or ZIP file.
  
The system must:
- Send notifications to administrators whenever any active sensor stops working.

Here there are the system classes depicted.
